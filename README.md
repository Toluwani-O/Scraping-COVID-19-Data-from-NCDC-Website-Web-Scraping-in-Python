# Web Scraping Project using Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to the Web Scraping Project repository! This project involves using Python and Jupyter Notebook to perform web scraping, extracting valuable data from websites. The data collected can be used for analysis, insights, or any other purpose based on your project's goals.

## Overview

This project focuses on web scraping that extracts COVID-19 data from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) website in Nigeria.
The purpose of this project is the collection of COVID-19 data for analysis, visualization, and monitoring of the situation in Nigeria. By scraping the NCDC website, we can obtain the most up-to-date and accurate information about COVID-19 cases nationwide.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of web scraping using Python. By extracting data from websites, we aim to showcase the power of automation in obtaining valuable information that can be used for various purposes such as analysis, reporting, or research.

## Files

- **Web_Scraping_Project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step process of web scraping. The notebook explains the libraries used, the target websites, and the extracted data.

- **data.csv**: A sample dataset showcasing the extracted data in a structured format.

- **README.md**: The current document, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Web Scraping Process

The web scraping process involves the following key steps:

1. **Identifying Target Websites**: Selection of websites from which data will be scraped.

2. **Choosing Libraries**: Selection of appropriate Python libraries, such as Beautiful Soup and Requests, for extracting data from HTML.

3. **Extracting Data**: Writing code to fetch specific data elements, such as text, images, or links, from the website's HTML structure.

4. **Data Transformation**: Structuring the extracted data into a usable format, such as a CSV file or a database.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-project.git`.

2. Open the `Web_Scraping_Project.ipynb` notebook to view the step-by-step process of web scraping and data extraction.

3. Utilize the extracted data for your analysis or any other intended purpose.
